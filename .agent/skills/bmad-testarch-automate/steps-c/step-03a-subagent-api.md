# Subagent 3A: Generate API Tests

## SUBAGENT CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subagent** running in parallel with E2E test generation.

**What you have from parent workflow:**

- Target features/components identified in Step 2
- Knowledge fragments loaded: playwright-utils-mandate, overview, api-request, recurse, log, auth-session, data-factories, api-testing-patterns
- Config: test framework, `use_playwright_utils` (default `true`), Pact.js Utils enabled/disabled, Pact MCP mode
- Coverage plan: which API endpoints need testing

**When `use_playwright_utils` is `true`, `playwright-utils-mandate.md` binds this worker.** Generate in the playwright-utils style without being asked; a vanilla Playwright call is a deviation that must carry a stated reason.

**Your task:** Generate API tests ONLY (not E2E, not fixtures, not other test types).

**If `use_pactjs_utils` is enabled AND contract artifacts are explicitly in scope for this subagent:** `pactjs-utils-mandate.md` binds every Pact artifact you emit. Its substitutions are not optional: `.given(...createProviderState({ name, params }))` rather than a hand-cast `.given()`, `setJsonContent` / `setJsonBody` rather than repeated inline PactV4 builder lambdas, `buildVerifierOptions` and `buildMessageVerifierOptions` rather than literal options objects, scoped `consumer` + `consumerBranch` rather than a hand-built branch selector, `isBreakingChangeTolerantBranch` rather than repeated branch-name checks, `createRequestFilter` / `noOpRequestFilter` rather than bespoke auth middleware, and `zodToPactMatchers` where the project already has a Zod schema. Import only from `@seontechnologies/pactjs-utils`. Run the mandate's self-check before writing each file, and record anything that survives in `pactjs_utils_deviations` with a reason.

Apply pactjs-utils conventions from the loaded fragments (`pactjs-utils-overview`, `pactjs-utils-consumer-helpers`, `pactjs-utils-provider-verifier`, `pactjs-utils-request-filter`, `pact-consumer-framework-setup`) when generating contract-level API test scaffolding. Full consumer/provider suite generation — including edits to `vitest.config.pact.ts`, `vitest.config.contract.ts`, `package.json` scripts (`test:pact:consumer`, `test:pact:consumer:run`), and `scripts/publish-pact.sh` — must be triggered explicitly by the parent workflow flag `tea_use_pactjs_utils: true`; do not generate those artifacts implicitly. When in scope, enforce these determinism/FFI-safety rules:

- **Consumer tests**: exactly one `pact.addInteraction()` per `it()` block (use `it.each` for parameterized cases) — PactV4's Rust FFI drops interactions otherwise.
- **Consumer Vitest config**: `vitest.config.pact.ts` must include BOTH `fileParallelism: false` AND `pool: 'forks'` + `poolOptions.forks.singleFork: true`. `fileParallelism: false` prevents workers racing on the shared pact JSON; forks + singleFork prevents the `@pact-foundation/pact` Rust FFI from leaking state across files on Linux CI.
- **Provider Vitest config**: `vitest.config.contract.ts` must include `pool: 'forks'` + `poolOptions.forks.singleFork: true` (same rule as consumer) for multi-file and message-provider suites.
- **Consumer `package.json`**: generate both `test:pact:consumer` (determinism gate calling `scripts/check-pact-determinism.sh`) and `test:pact:consumer:run` (inner vitest invocation).
- **Publish script**: `scripts/publish-pact.sh` normalizes interactions with `jq -S '.interactions |= sort_by(...)'` before `pact-broker publish`.

Gate broker calls on `pact_mcp_reachable`, not on `pact_mcp`. The mode says the user allows a broker; the probe result says whether one answered. When `pact_mcp_reachable` is `true`, use the SmartBear MCP tools (Fetch Provider States, Generate Pact Tests) to inform generation. When it is `false`, take provider states from `pact_fallback_source` and say so in the output. Do not probe again: Step 1 already did, once.

## SUBAGENT TASK

### 1. Identify API Endpoints

From the coverage plan (Step 2 output), identify:

- Which API endpoints need test coverage
- Expected request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Error scenarios to test

### 2. Generate API Test Files

For each API endpoint, create test file in `tests/api/[feature].spec.ts`:

**Test Structure — when `use_playwright_utils` is `true` (the default). This is the shape you emit:**

```typescript
import { test, expect, log } from '../support/merged-fixtures';
import { endpointPayload } from '../support/factories';

test.describe('[Feature] API Tests', () => {
  test('[P0] should handle successful [operation]', async ({ apiRequest, authToken }) => {
    await log.step('POST /api/endpoint');

    const { status, body } = await apiRequest<CreatedResource>({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/api/endpoint',
      body: endpointPayload(),
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}` },
    });

    expect(status).toBe(201);
    expect(body).toMatchObject({
      /* expected */
    });
  });

  test('[P1] should handle [error scenario]', async ({ apiRequest }) => {
    const { status, body } = await apiRequest({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/api/endpoint',
      body: {
        /* invalid */
      },
    });

    expect(status).toBe(422);
    expect(body.errors).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

Drop the `authToken` fixture from the signature when the project has no auth provider wired, and say so in the summary. Do not replace it with an inline login.

**Test Structure — when `use_playwright_utils` is `false`:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('[Feature] API Tests', () => {
  test('[P0] should handle successful [operation]', async ({ request }) => {
    const response = await request.post('/api/endpoint', {
      data: {
        /* test data */
      },
    });

    expect(response.status()).toBe(201);
    expect(await response.json()).toMatchObject({
      /* expected */
    });
  });
});
```

**Playwright Utils Mandate (when `use_playwright_utils` is `true`):**

Follow `playwright-utils-mandate.md`. In an API worker that means:

- ✅ `apiRequest({ method, path, body?, headers? })` for every application endpoint. It returns `{ status, body }` already parsed and retries 5xx on its own.
- ✅ `recurse(fn, predicate, { timeout })` for anything eventually consistent — job completion, queue drain, cache propagation. Never a `while` loop, never `page.waitForTimeout`.
- ✅ `log.step` / `log.info` for anything the report should show. Never `console.log`.
- ✅ Schema validation through `apiRequest` (JSON Schema, Zod, or OpenAPI) instead of a hand-written field-by-field `expect` chain, whenever a schema exists.
- ✅ `authToken` from the auth-session fixture for authenticated calls. If no provider is wired, note it in the summary rather than inlining a login.
- ✅ `handleDownload` plus `readCSV` / `readXLSX` / `readPDF` / `readZIP` for export endpoints. Never a hand-rolled parser.
- ❌ `request.get/post/put/patch/delete` on the raw context, `await response.json()`, `console.log`, `page.waitForTimeout`.
- ❌ `import { test } from '@playwright/test'` in a spec. Import `test` from the project's merged fixtures; `expect` may still come from `@playwright/test` (playwright-utils does not re-export it).

Package and subpaths are exactly `@seontechnologies/playwright-utils`, `@seontechnologies/playwright-utils/api-request`, and `@seontechnologies/playwright-utils/api-request/fixtures`. No other package name is valid.

Before writing each file, run the self-check in `playwright-utils-mandate.md`. If a vanilla call survives, either fix it or mark it `// playwright-utils deviation: <reason>` and list it in the output `summary`.

This mandate does not apply to Pact/Vitest contract artifacts below, which follow the `pactjs-utils-*` fragments.

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Use data factories for test data (from data-factories fragment)
- ✅ Follow API testing patterns (from api-testing-patterns fragment)
- ✅ Include priority tags [P0], [P1], [P2], [P3]
- ✅ Test both happy path and error scenarios
- ✅ Use proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Deterministic assertions (no timing dependencies)

**If Pact.js Utils enabled (from `subagentContext.config.use_pactjs_utils`):**

- ✅ Generate consumer contract tests in `pact/http/consumer/` using `createProviderState({ name, params })` pattern
- ✅ Generate provider verification tests in `pact/http/provider/` using `buildVerifierOptions({ provider, port, includeMainAndDeployed, stateHandlers })` pattern
- ✅ Generate request filter helpers in `pact/http/helpers/` using `createRequestFilter({ tokenGenerator: () => string })`
- ✅ Generate shared state constants in `pact/http/helpers/states.ts`
- ✅ If async/message patterns detected, generate message consumer tests in `pact/message/` using `buildMessageVerifierOptions`
- ✅ **Provider endpoint comment MANDATORY** on every Pact interaction: `// Provider endpoint: <path> -> <METHOD> <route>`
- ⚠️ **Postel's Law for matchers**: Use `like()`, `eachLike()`, `string()`, `integer()` matchers ONLY in `willRespondWith` (responses). Request bodies in `withRequest` MUST use exact values — never wrap request bodies in `like()`. The consumer controls what it sends, so contracts should be strict about request shape.

### 1.5 Provider Source Scrutiny (CDC Only)

**CRITICAL**: Before generating ANY Pact consumer interaction, perform provider source scrutiny per the **Seven-Point Scrutiny Checklist** defined in `contract-testing.md`. Do NOT generate response matchers from consumer-side types alone — this is the #1 cause of contract verification failures.

The seven points to verify for each interaction:

1. Response shape
2. Status codes
3. Field names
4. Enum values
5. Required fields
6. Data types
7. Nested structures

**Source priority**: Provider source code is most authoritative. When an OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists (`openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`, `swagger.json`), use it as a complementary or alternative source — it documents the provider's contract explicitly and can be faster to parse than tracing through handler code. When both exist, cross-reference them; if they disagree, the source code wins. Document the discrepancy in the scrutiny evidence block (e.g., `OpenAPI shows 200 but handler returns 201; using handler behavior`) and flag it in the output JSON `summary` so it is discoverable by downstream consumers or audits.

**Scrutiny Sequence** (for each endpoint in the coverage plan):

1. **READ provider route handler and/or OpenAPI spec**: Find the handler file from `subagentContext.config.provider_endpoint_map` or by scanning the provider codebase. Also check for OpenAPI/Swagger spec files. Extract:
   - Exact status codes returned (`res.status(201)` / OpenAPI `responses` keys)
   - Response construction (`res.json({ data: ... })` / OpenAPI `schema`)
   - Error handling paths (what status codes for what conditions)

2. **READ provider type/model/DTO definitions**: Find the response type referenced by the handler or OpenAPI `$ref` schemas. Extract:
   - Exact field names (`transaction_id` not `transactionId`)
   - Field types (`string` ID vs `number` ID / OpenAPI `type` + `format`)
   - Optional vs required fields (OpenAPI `required` array)
   - Nested object structures (OpenAPI `$ref`, `allOf`, `oneOf`)

3. **READ provider validation schemas**: Find Joi/Zod/class-validator schemas or OpenAPI request body `schema.required`. Extract:
   - Required request fields and headers
   - Enum/union type allowed values (`"active" | "inactive"` / OpenAPI `enum`)
   - Request body constraints

4. **Cross-reference findings** against consumer expectations:
   - Does the consumer expect the same field names the provider sends?
   - Does the consumer expect the same status codes the provider returns?
   - Does the consumer expect the same nesting the provider produces?

5. **Document scrutiny evidence** as a block comment in the generated test:

```typescript
/*
 * Provider Scrutiny Evidence:
 * - Handler: server/src/routes/userHandlers.ts:45
 * - OpenAPI: server/openapi.yaml paths./api/v2/users/{userId}.get (if available)
 * - Response type: UserResponseDto (server/src/types/user.ts:12)
 * - Status: 201 for creation (line 52), 400 for validation error (line 48)
 * - Fields: { id: number, name: string, email: string, role: "user" | "admin" }
 * - Required request headers: Authorization (Bearer token)
 */
```

6. **Graceful degradation** when provider source is not accessible (follows the canonical four-step protocol from `contract-testing.md`):
   1. **OpenAPI/Swagger spec available**: Use the spec as the source of truth for response shapes, status codes, and field names
   2. **Pact Broker available** (when `pact_mcp` is `"mcp"` in `subagentContext.config`): Use SmartBear MCP tools to fetch existing provider states and verified interactions as reference
   3. **Neither available**: Generate from consumer types but use the TODO form of the mandatory comment: `// Provider endpoint: TODO — provider source not accessible, verify manually`. Set `provider_scrutiny: "pending"` in output JSON
   4. **Never silently guess**: Document all assumptions in the scrutiny evidence block

> ⚠️ **Anti-pattern**: Generating response matchers from consumer-side types alone. This produces contracts that reflect what the consumer _wishes_ the provider returns, not what it _actually_ returns. Always read provider source or OpenAPI spec first.

### 3. Track Fixture Needs

Identify fixtures needed for API tests:

- Authentication fixtures (auth tokens, API keys)
- Data factories (user data, product data, etc.)
- API client configurations

**Do NOT create fixtures yet** - just track what's needed for aggregation step.

## EXIT CONDITION

Subagent completes when:

- ✅ All API endpoints have test files generated
- ✅ All tests follow knowledge fragment patterns
- ✅ JSON output written to temp file
- ✅ Fixture needs tracked

**Subagent terminates here.** Parent workflow will read output and proceed to aggregation.

---

## 🚨 SUBAGENT SUCCESS METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All API tests generated following patterns
- JSON output valid and complete
- No E2E/component/unit tests included (out of scope)
- Playwright Utils mandate satisfied (if enabled): `apiRequest` for every application endpoint, `recurse` for async waits, `log` for report output, `test` imported from merged fixtures, and every remaining vanilla call listed in `playwright_utils_deviations` with a reason
- Pact.js Utils mandate satisfied (if CDC enabled): `createProviderState`, `buildVerifierOptions`, `createRequestFilter`, and no hand-cast `JsonMap`; anything else listed in `pactjs_utils_deviations` with a reason
- Every Pact interaction has `// Provider endpoint:` comment (if CDC enabled)
- Provider source scrutiny completed or gracefully degraded with TODO markers (if CDC enabled)
- Scrutiny evidence documented as block comments in test files (if CDC enabled)

### ❌ FAILURE:

- Generated tests other than API tests
- Did not follow knowledge fragment patterns
- Invalid or missing JSON output
- Ran tests (not subagent responsibility)
- Emitted raw `request.<method>`, `await response.json()`, `console.log`, or `page.waitForTimeout` while `use_playwright_utils` was `true`, with no deviation entry
- Imported `test` from `@playwright/test` in a spec while `use_playwright_utils` was `true`
- Used a package name other than `@seontechnologies/playwright-utils`
- Emitted a hand-cast `.given()`, a literal `VerifierOptions`, or bespoke auth middleware while `use_pactjs_utils` was `true`, with no deviation entry
- Pact interactions missing provider endpoint comments (if CDC enabled)
- Response matchers generated from consumer-side types without provider scrutiny (if CDC enabled)
