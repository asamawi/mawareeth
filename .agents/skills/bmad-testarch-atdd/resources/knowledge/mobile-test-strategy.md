# Mobile Test Strategy

## Principle

Mobile applies the same level discipline as any other stack: push verification to the cheapest level that can carry it, and reserve device-level flows for what genuinely requires a device. The mobile-specific part is that the expensive level is **much** more expensive (emulator boot, app install, real network) and the risk surface includes conditions web apps do not have: permissions, backgrounding, offline, deep links, and OS version fragmentation.

## Rationale

**The Problem**: Mobile suites tend to collapse into one level. Teams write end-to-end device flows for everything because that is the only tool they set up, then watch a 40-flow suite take 50 minutes and fail for reasons unrelated to the change. The opposite failure is equally common: unit-testing every reducer and shipping an app nobody ever launched in CI.

**The Solution**: Split by what actually needs the device. Business logic, formatting, state reduction, and API clients are unit and integration concerns and do not need a simulator. Component or screen tests cover rendering and interaction without a full app launch. Device flows exist for the journeys where the integration of app, OS, and backend is itself the risk.

**Why This Matters**:

- Suite runtime stays inside a PR-gate budget
- Failures point at the layer that broke
- Device capacity is spent on the risks only a device can prove
- The same P0-P3 prioritization used elsewhere in TEA transfers unchanged

## The Mobile Test Level Framework

| Level                     | Runs on                    | Covers                                                                  | Typical share (indicative) |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Unit**                  | Node / JVM / Swift runtime | Pure logic, reducers, formatters, validation, mappers                   | 60-70%                     |
| **Component / screen**    | Test renderer, no device   | Rendering, props, interaction handlers, conditional UI                  | 20-25%                     |
| **Contract**              | No device                  | The app's HTTP boundary against its backend (Pact or schema validation) | small, high value          |
| **Device flow (Maestro)** | Simulator/emulator/device  | Cross-screen journeys, permissions, deep links, background/foreground   | 5-15%                      |
| **Manual / exploratory**  | Real device                | Gestures, haptics, biometrics, accessibility, real-network degradation  | remainder                  |

**Duplicate coverage guard** (same rule as every other stack): before adding a device flow, check whether a component test or a contract test already proves the behavior. A device flow that only verifies a label renders is a unit test wearing a 90-second costume.

## What Belongs in a Device Flow

Promote to a Maestro flow when the risk is in the **integration**, not the logic:

- P0 revenue or access journeys end to end (sign in, purchase, submit claim)
- OS permission grants and denials, including the denied path
- Deep link entry into a specific screen. The app's own parsing and routing is testable even in a development shell, through the shell's routed URL form; the OS-level handoff needs the app's custom scheme registered, which a shell does not do.
- Universal Links and Android App Links are a **separate** surface from custom-scheme deep links, and the same shell trick does not cover them. A verified HTTPS link depends on the platform's domain association (`apple-app-site-association`, `assetlinks.json`) being served and accepted, so a shell-routed URL exercises the in-app routing while proving nothing about whether the OS would have handed the link over at all. Score and cover the association separately from the routing.
- Background, foreground, and process-death restoration
- Offline and reconnect behavior
- Push notification tap-through
- App upgrade with existing local data (explicit exception to clearState isolation: seeds previous-build state, installs the new build without clearState, asserts migration, and cleans up in teardown)

Keep out of device flows:

- Field-level input validation (component level)
- Every variant of a list cell (component level)
- Error message copy (component level)
- API error mapping (contract or unit level)

## Mobile Risk Categories

Extends the standard TEA risk categories with the conditions unique to the platform. Score each with the usual probability × impact 1-9 scale.

| Category             | Example risk                                         | Typical level             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Permissions**      | Camera denied leaves the user on a dead screen       | Device flow               |
| **Lifecycle**        | State lost when the OS kills a backgrounded app      | Device flow               |
| **Connectivity**     | Offline write is silently discarded on reconnect     | Device flow + unit        |
| **Fragmentation**    | Layout breaks on a small screen or an older OS       | Device matrix             |
| **Upgrade**          | Local database migration corrupts existing user data | Device flow               |
| **Store compliance** | Missing privacy declaration blocks release           | Release checklist         |
| **Performance**      | Cold start over budget, frame drops on scroll        | Instrumented, not Maestro |
| **Binary size**      | Growth pushes past a cellular download threshold     | CI metric                 |

Cold start, frame rate, memory, and binary size are NFR evidence. Collect them with platform instrumentation and audit them in the NFR workflow; do not try to assert them from a Maestro flow.

## Device Matrix

Pick the matrix from risk, not from availability. A defensible minimum:

- **Primary**: newest OS on the highest-usage device for each platform
- **Floor**: the oldest OS version the app still supports
- **Form factor**: one small screen, and a tablet only if the app ships a tablet layout

Run the full matrix nightly and on release candidates. Run the primary target only on PRs, because a PR gate that boots six emulators stops being a gate people wait for.

**The PR-gate profile and the local profile must be the same one.** A different screen height moves content below the fold, and `assertVisible` means inside the viewport, so a shorter runner device fails UI assertions that pass on every developer machine and reads as a product defect. Compare on density-independent height rather than pixel resolution: two profiles can share `1080x` and differ by 100dp. The matrix exists to find fragmentation defects, and it can only do that from a gate that is not producing them by accident. See `mobile-ci-device-lab.md`.

## CI Shape

- **Build artifact first**: decide what the flows run against before writing any of them. A release-shaped build (unsigned APK, simulator IPA) is the default; a prebuilt development shell such as Expo Go is not a CI artifact, because the native modules the flows need are absent and the launch path exists only in CI. This decision sets the failure surface of the whole suite; see `mobile-ci-device-lab.md`.
- **PR gate**: unit + component + contract on every push. P0-tagged Maestro flows on the primary target only.
- **Nightly**: full Maestro suite across the device matrix.
- **Release candidate**: full suite plus the upgrade-path flow from the previous production build.
- **Artifacts**: Maestro writes per-step statuses, a hierarchy dump, screenshots, a video, and device logs per run. Upload all of them, and diagnose from the per-step status and the hierarchy dump captured at failure. The failure screenshot is taken after teardown and often shows the launcher rather than the failing screen, so leading with it produces confident wrong answers.
- **No live third-party evaluation in the run path**: a flow asserting behavior behind a remotely evaluated feature flag hands the outcome to a third-party service, for a user the run created seconds earlier. Start the environment with the remote provider unconfigured, so the service falls back to its seeded local value, and seed that value as test data. The same applies to remote personalization and experiment services. See `feature-flags.md` for the flag-testing patterns this reuses.
- **Burn-in**: applies to mobile the same way it applies to browser E2E. New or changed flows run repeatedly before merge, because device flows are the most flake-prone level in the suite.
- **Sharding**: shard by flow file across parallel emulators, and pick the shard count from measured wall clock rather than from per-flow duration. Oversubscribing the host stretches every flow while still finishing the run sooner, and wall clock is what gates the PR. Each parallel device also needs its own fixture account and a way to know which one is its own; on Android that identity has to be written to the device rather than read from it (`mobile-ci-device-lab.md`).

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern                                           | Why it fails                                                                                                           | Fix                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Every acceptance criterion becomes a device flow       | Suite runtime explodes; failures are slow to diagnose                                                                  | Apply the level framework and the duplicate-coverage guard                               |
| Full device matrix on every PR                         | Gate becomes too slow to block on, so people bypass it                                                                 | Primary target on PRs, matrix nightly                                                    |
| Performance asserted inside a Maestro flow             | Measures the harness, not the app                                                                                      | Platform instrumentation as NFR evidence                                                 |
| Flows depend on a shared logged-in account             | Parallel runs collide; failures are not reproducible                                                                   | Per-run accounts/data or explicit backend reset when server state changes                |
| No offline or permission-denied coverage               | The paths users actually hit in the wild are the untested ones                                                         | Score them as risks; they are usually P0 or P1                                           |
| Testing against a production backend                   | Non-deterministic data, and a test order can mutate real state                                                         | Dedicated environment or a stubbed backend                                               |
| Device flows run through a prebuilt development shell  | Native modules are absent, so notifications and payments can only be asserted missing; the launch path is CI-only      | Build a release-shaped artifact and install it (`mobile-ci-device-lab.md`)               |
| A surface written off as untestable without a check    | The coarse claim is often wrong: a shell routes its own deep-link URL form into the app, so link handling is reachable | Test the claim before dropping coverage; name the part that is genuinely out of reach    |
| Flow asserts behavior behind a remotely evaluated flag | A third-party service decides the outcome, for a user created seconds earlier                                          | Unconfigure the remote provider so the seeded local value wins, and seed it as test data |

## Mobile Strategy Checklist

- [ ] **Build artifact decided**: flows run against a release-shaped or development build, never a prebuilt development shell
- [ ] **Levels assigned**: each acceptance criterion mapped to unit, component, contract, or device flow
- [ ] **Duplicate coverage checked**: no device flow proving something a cheaper level already proves
- [ ] **Mobile risk categories scored**: permissions, lifecycle, connectivity, fragmentation, upgrade
- [ ] **Device matrix justified**: primary, floor, and form factor chosen from usage data
- [ ] **PR-gate profile matches the local profile**, compared on density-independent height
- [ ] **PR gate bounded**: P0 flows on the primary target only
- [ ] **NFR evidence separated**: cold start, frame rate, memory, binary size instrumented rather than asserted in flows
- [ ] **No live third-party flag or experiment service in the run path**: remote evaluation disabled, values seeded as test data
- [ ] **Artifacts uploaded**: video, screenshot, and hierarchy dump on failure
- [ ] **Burn-in enabled** for new and changed flows
- [ ] **Parallel devices carry distinct fixture accounts**, keyed on an identity the run wrote and verified
